# Real Time Whisper Transcription



This is a demo of real time speech to text with OpenAI's Whisper model. It works by constantly recording audio in a thread and concatenating the raw bytes over multiple recordings. This is a fork from: https://github.com/davabase/whisper_real_time with the goal of implementing it with faster-whisper instead of OpenAI's Whisper. This fork also allows for distilled models. 

To install dependencies simply run
```
[IN PROGRESS]
```
in an environment of your choosing.

faster-whisper does not require ffmpeg, so there are no installation instructions for ffmpeg given here.
